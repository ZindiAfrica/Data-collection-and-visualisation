# Competition Summary

## Description

Gender-based violence is a serious pandemic in Africa and globally.

In the first part of this competition, we called on the Zindi community to create and uncover datasets that relate to gender-based violence in Africa. 

The community submitted a wide range of datasets on social media, laws and regulations, attitudes towards GBV, academic research, and others. 

The objective of this challenge is to use these datasets to create a solution that helps in the fight against GBV in Africa.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The data for this challenge are all the dataset collected from the AFD Gender-Based Violence Dataset Collection Challenge.

No external dataset are allowed after a certain date.

All data shared on the discussion board was reviewed by Zindi before use.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

Submissions were evaluated by a panel of judges on the following criteria;

. Potential impact of the solution 

. Powerful use of data

. Uniqueness of the solution

. Overall wow factor

. Documentation 

## Prizes

1st Place: $2 500 USD

2nd Place: $1 500 USD

3rd Place: $1 000 USD

## Benefits
